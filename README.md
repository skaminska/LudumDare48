# Ludum Dare 48

This is code from the game that I created on my second game jam. The theme of the jam was "Deeper and deeper" so I created a game about a submarine that the player needs to upgrade to dive deeper.

Extremely simple as I was learning Unity for ~3 months and have only 3 days to make it.
